Researchers at Tsinghua University have developed a new type of Domestic EUV Photoresist based on polytellurium oxanea material that could play a critical role in next-generation chipmaking. The breakthrough isnt just a technical winits a strategic play in Chinas broader goal of semiconductor self-reliance. With U.S. export controls tightening and Japanese firms dominating the photoresist market, China is racing to localize production of the highly specialized materials needed for chips at 7nm and below. This could mark a turning point in the global chip supply chain, and a serious wake-up call for the EUV photoresist market currently controlled by Japans JSR and Koreas Dongjin Semichem. Quick 5-Point Overview Breakthrough Material: Tsinghua developed a new Te-based EUV photoresist to enhance lithography performance. Strategic Importance: The innovation supports Chinas 2025 semiconductor self-reliance plan. Performance Boost: Tellurium offers superior EUV absorption and better pattern resolution. Global Impact: This could disrupt the Japan-Korea duopoly in EUV photoresist materials. Backed by Policy: Supported by over 50 billion in national funding under Chinas IC Investment Fund Phase III. The Background: Why EUV Photoresist Matters EUV photoresists are critical materials in semiconductor manufacturing. They enable EUV lithography, which uses light with a wavelength of 13.5nm to carve ultra-fine patterns onto silicon wafers. This technique is essential for producing chips at 7nm and below, which power AI processors, smartphones, and GPUs. But the photoresist must meet tough technical requirementslike high sensitivity, uniformity, and minimal line edge roughness. The EUV source itself is dim, so the photoresist has to do more of the heavy lifting. Right now, China imports nearly 100 of its EUV photoresist, mostly from Japan and Korea. According to JRJ.com, domestic production of older photoresist types like KrFArF remains below 5. For EUV photoresist, the gap is even wider. Thats a huge risk in todays techno-geopolitical climate. techovedas.comupturns-and-downturns-5-reasons-the-semiconductor-industry-market-is-so-volatile Inside the Breakthrough: Tellurium for the Win Tsinghuas researchpublished in Science Advances on July 16, 2025introduces a polytellurium oxane-based polymer that shows promise as a next-gen EUV photoresist. Heres what makes it different: It uses Tellurium (Te), a heavy element that absorbs EUV light more effectively than traditional metals like Zinc, Tin, or Hafnium. The TeO (tellurium-oxygen) bond in the polymer backbone breaks easily when hit by EUV light. That makes the photoresist more sensitive and accurate. The polymer structure improves energy transfer and pattern definitiontwo critical issues in EUV lithography. This isnt just a lab experiment. The material meets all four performance pillars laid out by Tsinghua: EUV Photoresist TraitImportanceTsinghuas Te-Based SolutionHigh EUV AbsorptionBoosts photon efficiency Tellurium absorbs betterEnergy UtilizationReduces power requirement TeO bonds break efficientlyMolecular UniformityImproves pattern fidelity Engineered polymer backbonePattern SensitivityEnables lower EUV dose usage High reactivity upon exposure If scalable, this could redefine the EUV photoresist market. techovedas.comchinas-7nm-chips-a-threat-to-us-supremacy Why China Wants to Cut the Cord from Japan Japans JSR Corporation is the dominant supplier of EUV photoresists, followed by South Koreas Dongjin Semichem. These companies are deeply integrated with ASML, the sole supplier of EUV lithography machines used by chip giants like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. But with U.S. export bans and Japan aligning with Western tech policy, China faces growing restrictions on access to these materials. Thats where the government comes in. National Semiconductor Strategy Chinas National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Phase III Planunveiled in 2024set aside over 50 billion (7 billion) for domestic RD in areas like: EUV photoresists Substrate materials Etching gases CMP slurries Advanced packaging tools This aligns with the Made in China 2025 initiative, which lists semiconductor self-reliance as a top priority. Tsinghuas breakthrough fits directly into this framework. Follow us on Linkedin for everything around Semiconductors  AI Not Just ScienceBut Strategy This isnt just about chemistry. Its about control. With AI workloads exploding, demand for advanced chips is growing fast. China is the largest consumer of semiconductors, but lacks homegrown access to the most advanced nodes.

470亿美元：中国“大基金”启动投资基金以加强芯片产业,$47 Billion: China’s ‘Big Fund’ Begins Investment Fund to Strengthen Chip Industry,中国正式启动第三期国家支持的半导体投资计划“大基金”，投资额高达344亿元人民币（约47亿美元），旨在加速国内芯片生产，减少对外国技术的依赖。此举正值美国可能对中国半导体进口实施新限制之际，中国希望通过巨额投资减少对西方技术的依赖，发展国产替代品，并在全球半导体技术领域取得领先地位。,techovedas,2025-07-26 16:21:34,"Introduction China has officially launched the third phase of its state-backed semiconductor investment initiative, known as the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment chip Fund or Big Fund, with a massive 344 billion yuan (47 billion) war chest. This move aims to accelerate domestic chip production and reduce dependence on foreign technology, especially as newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump considers fresh restrictions on Chinese semiconductor imports. techovedas.comis-apple-moving-iphone-production-to-indonesia-to-lift-the-sales-ban-on-iphone-16google_vignette Key Takeaways Massive Investment  Chinas latest 47 billion semiconductor chip fund has started investing to boost its domestic chip industry. Strategic Timing  The fund launch comes amid concerns over possible U.S. trade sanctions under Donald Trumps new administration. Focus on Independence  Beijing aims to strengthen its chip supply chain and reduce reliance on foreign semiconductor technology. Partnerships for Growth  The fund has teamed up with Huaxin Investment Management, backed by China Development Bank. Long-Term Vision  China wants to become a global leader in semiconductor technology, countering U.S. and Western restrictions. Chinas 47 Billion Chip War Chest: What It Means Chinas Big Fund was first introduced in 2014 to accelerate the countrys semiconductor development and reduce reliance on imports. Since then, it has played a pivotal role in funding Chinese chipmakers like SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.) and Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp. (YMTC). With the launch of Phase 3, China has now invested over 100 billion in semiconductor funding across the past decade. This latest phase signals a renewed push to overcome U.S. sanctions and establish a self-sufficient chip supply chain. Why China Is Investing Heavily in Semiconductors U.S.-China Tech War Intensifies Since 2018, the U.S. has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Chinas tech sector, restricting the sale of advanced chips and manufacturing equipment. The Biden administration further tightened export controls in 2022 and 2023, cutting Chinas access to AI chips from companies like NVIDIA and AMD. With Trump back in office, Chinese policymakers fear even stricter measures could follow. By pouring billions into domestic chipmaking, Beijing hopes to reduce its reliance on Western technology and develop homegrown alternatives. The Role of the Big Fund Chinas Big Fund is not just about moneyit is part of a national strategy to dominate the semiconductor industry. It provides funding for RD, manufacturing, and supply chain development across different semiconductor sectors, including: Logic chips (used in processors and AI applications) Memory chips (for data storage) Analog and power chips (essential for electronics) Chip manufacturing equipment (to replace U.S.-made tools) The goal is to create a self-sufficient ecosystem, where Chinese companies can produce everything from raw materials to finished semiconductor products. 3. Strategic Partnerships with State-Owned Enterprises The 93 billion yuan (13 billion) initial investment from the Big Fund Phase 3 was launched in partnership with Huaxin Investment Management. This firm is backed by the state-owned China Development Bank, a key financial institution supporting Chinas tech ambitions. Other key players expected to receive funding include: SMIC  Chinas top semiconductor foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor  A leading chip manufacturer CXMT (ChangXin Memory Technologies)  A rising competitor in DRAM chips YMTC  Chinas flagship NAND flash memory maker By strengthening these domestic companies, China hopes to reduce dependence on U.S. and European chip suppliers. techovedas.comsmic-q4-profit-plunges-38-despite-31-revenue-surge-amid-u-s-sanctions Challenges Facing Chinas Semiconductor Push U.S. Export Controls The biggest hurdle for China remains U.S. sanctions, which limit its access to advanced chip-making equipment from firms like ASML (Netherlands), Applied Materials (U.S.), and Tokyo Electron (Japan). Without this equipment, Chinese firms struggle to manufacture chips at the same level as TSMC (Taiwan), Samsung (South Korea), or Intel (U.S.). https:medium.comp46b286868883 Talent and Innovation Gap China has made significant progress in semiconductor RD, but it still lags behind the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea in advanced chip design. Companies like Huawei have made breakthroughs, but China lacks the high-end talent and software tools needed for next-generation chips. Rising Production Costs Developing a self-sufficient chip industry is extremely expensive. Even with 47 billion chip fund, China needs to spend hundreds of billions more to catch up with leading firms like TSMC and Samsung. techovedas.comrs-10000-crore-lam-research-to-invest-in-india-to-strengthen-local-industry The Future of Chinas Semiconductor Industry Despite these challenges, China is determined to close the gap with the U.S. and o...",其他,https://techovedas.com/47-billion-chinas-big-fund-begins-investment-fund-to-strengthen-chip-industry/,0.7899999999999999,"semiconductor, international_cooperation",文章内容与上海科技政策和产业发展规划具有较高的相关性。上海作为中国的经济中心之一，其科技发展政策与国家战略紧密相连，特别是在半导体和集成电路领域，上海一直积极推动相关产业的发展。因此，国家层面的半导体投资计划对上海具有重要的政策相关性。文章所述技术或事件对科技创新的推动作用显著，因为半导体技术是现代科技发展的关键，中国加大投资力度有望加速国内芯片产业的自主创新和技术突破。然而，文章内容的可操作性和对实际工作的指导价值相对较低，因为文章主要聚焦于国家层面的投资计划，而未具体涉及上海地区的实施细节和操作步骤。综合来看，文章对上海科技发展具有一定的参考价值，但需要结合上海本地的实际情况进行深入分析和规划。

Scientists long believed it arose from rough surfaces rubbing together, where tiny bumps and sticky spots resisted motion and transformed energy into heat. As experimental tools advance, scientists are pushing beyond classical friction laws to investigate friction at the atomic scale. In a recent study, a Chinese team from the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, led by Professor Zhang Junyan and Associate Professor Gong Zhenbin, used precise nanomanipulation to create folded graphene edges with controlled curvature and layer numbers, enabling detailed measurements of friction at the nanoscale. Their findings revealed that friction at the folded edges of graphene does not follow a linear pattern as layer numbers increase. Instead, it changes in a highly nonlinear fashionraising fundamental questions about the limits of classical friction models when applied to solid-solid quantum interfaces. Folding graphene to test limits of friction at the quantum scale A surprising discovery in 2022 revealed that water flows faster through narrower carbon nanotubesreversing what we see in everyday plumbing. Researchers linked this counterintuitive behavior to quantum friction, where fewer electrons in narrower tubes reduce resistance to flow, the South China Morning Post reported. Inspired by those findings, the Chinese scientists developed an approach which allowed them to probe the elusive effects of quantum friction at solid interfaces with unprecedented control. As the researchers increased the number of graphene layers in each fold, friction behaved unexpectedlyvarying in surprising ways and sometimes even decreasing with added thickness. According to the research team, this marks the first experimental evidence of quantum friction occurring between two solid surfaces. They emphasized the significance of the discovery in a social media post, highlighting its potential impact on future technologies. New way to reduce friction By folding the graphene, the researchers induced internal strain that altered how electrons moved through the material. This strain forced the electrons into fixed energy states, known as pseudo-Landau levels, which reduced energy loss as heat and ultimately lowered the friction at the interface. The researchers conducted their experiment using a carefully engineered graphene system cooled to ultra-low temperatures. Looking ahead, they plan to explore whether the same quantum friction effects can be observed in other materials and under conditions more relevant to real-world applications. Exploring quantum friction across a wider range of materials and temperature conditions, the researchers noted, could provide deeper insights into how energy is dissipated at the atomic level. In the long term, as the scientists note, this understanding may pave the way for technologies that actively manage or even minimize energy loss in practical devices, from nanoscale electronics to quantum computing systems. Their study can be found in the journal Nature Communications.",研究报告,https://interestingengineering.com/science/chinese-scientists-detect-rare-quantum-friction,0.8599999999999999,"semiconductor, advanced_materials",文章1报道了中国科学家在量子摩擦领域的突破性进展，这对于上海科技发展具有高度相关性，因为上海正在积极发展量子信息技术。这项研究不仅展示了中国在基础科学研究领域的能力，而且其发现可能对材料科学和纳米技术产生深远影响，具有很高的创新性和实用性。
中国新AI工具绘制2700万宇宙天体图谱，识别恒星、星系、类星体,"China’s new AI tool maps 27 million cosmic objects to spot stars, galaxies, quasars",中国科学家开发了一种新的人工智能工具，能够快速准确地识别和分类超过2700万个宇宙天体，包括恒星、星系和类星体。这一AI模型结合了形态特征和光谱能量分布（SED）信息，提高了分类的准确性和效率。在多个数据集上的测试显示，该模型的分类准确率高达99.7%，甚至能够纠正以往目录中的错误分类。这一工具有望改变我们探索和理解宇宙的方式，为未来的天文调查提供重要支持。,Interesting Engineering,2025-07-26 11:52:37,"Imagine trying to label every star, galaxy, or distant quasar in the sky, millions upon millions of them. Until now, this job relied heavily on a precise but slow method called spectroscopy, which is accurate, but simply cant keep up with the flood of data from modern sky surveys. Now, scientists in China have taken a leap forward by building an AI model that can do this job quickly and with astonishing accuracy. Their tool has already sorted more than 27 million cosmic objects in a wide stretch of the sky.However, its not just about saving time, the AI could completely change how we explore and understand the universe, making it possible to go through large data sets and uncover hidden patterns and rare celestial objects that were previously missed. AI harnesses shape and spectrum The team, led by researchers at the Yunnan Observatories, tackled a long-standing problem in astronomy. Many stars and quasars look alike in images, tiny, bright dots. Galaxies, depending on how far they are, can also appear similarly small. Relying on just how things look (their shape or structure) often leads to confusion. Using light patterns (called spectral energy distribution, or SED) helps, but by itself, it still leaves room for error, especially for faint or distant objects. So, the researchers designed a neural network, a type of artificial intelligence that learns from data. It is capable of handling two types of input at once: the morphological features (how an object looks) and its SED features (how its brightness varies across different wavelengths). This dual-input approach gave the model a better grip on the subtle differences between stars, galaxies, and quasars. They trained their model on spectroscopically confirmed sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys 17th data release, a trusted database with known object types. Then, they tested it using images from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), focusing on objects brighter than r  23 magnitude. The model processed data covering about 1,350 square degrees of sky and successfully classified over 27 million sources. This MNN successfully leverages both morphological and SED information to enable efficient and robust classification of stars, quasars, and galaxies in large photometric surveys, the study authors note. To check how reliable the model was, they tested it on other datasets. When applied to 3.4 million sources from the Gaia mission, mostly stars with known distances or motions. It correctly labeled 99.7 percent as stars. A similar success rate was seen with data from the GAMA survey, where the model accurately classified 99.7 percent of galaxies and quasars. Moreover, the AI even spotted past mistakes. Some objects labeled as stars in previous catalogs were actually galaxies, and the model managed to reclassify them correctly. This shows it could improve existing astronomical databases, too. A tool for tomorrows sky surveys This AI tool arrives at just the right time. With new sky surveys set to observe billions of objects in the coming years, astronomers need fast, accurate systems to handle the overload. This model doesnt replace spectroscopy, but it dramatically expands what we can do with photometric data alone. It could help discover rare types of stars or distant quasars, trace the structure of galaxies, and study how the universe evolved. However, the tool also has its limits. For instance, its accuracy depends on the quality of training data, and its performance may vary when used with other surveys that look at different parts of the sky or use different instruments. The researchers now aim to improve the models ability to handle even fainter objects and adapt it to future surveys. In short, theyve handed astronomy a smart assistant, one that sees the universe not just faster, but more clearly. The study is published in The Astrophysical Journal.",其他,https://interestingengineering.com/science/ai-can-classify-stars-and-galaxies,0.8599999999999999,artificial_intelligence,文章2介绍了中国科学家开发的AI工具，该工具能够快速准确地识别和分类数千万的宇宙天体。这项技术对于上海的科技发展具有相关性，尤其是在推动人工智能和大数据在天文领域的应用。该工具的创新性在于其处理大量数据的能力，以及可能揭示以前未被发现的宇宙模式和天体，具有很高的实用性和影响力。

Single metasurface to replace complex setups The research team at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), led by Professor Federico Capasso, has engineered a single metasurface to replace such complex setups. A metasurface is an ultra-thin planar device patterned with nanoscale structures that are smaller than the wavelength of light. These structures work together to precisely manipulate the properties of light, such as its phase and polarization. Were introducing a major technological advantage when it comes to solving the scalability problem, said Kerolos M.A. Yousef, a graduate student and the papers first author. Now we can miniaturize an entire optical setup into a single metasurface that is very stable and robust. Developing new design process A key part of the teams work was developing a new design process to handle the mathematical complexity of multi-photon quantum states. They applied graph theory, a field of mathematics that represents connections within a network. In this context, the points and lines of a graph were used to map the required interference pathways between photons. This abstract graph was then translated into the physical layout of the nanoscale patterns on the metasurface. With the graph approach, in a way, metasurface design and the optical quantum state become two sides of the same coin, noted research scientist Neal Sinclair. This method provides a systematic way to construct the device needed to generate a specific, complex quantum state. Design minimizes optical loss The resulting metasurface offers several practical benefits. Its monolithic design is inherently more stable and less susceptible to environmental perturbations than a setup built from many individual parts. It is fabricated using techniques common in the semiconductor industry, suggesting a path toward cost-effective and reproducible production. Furthermore, the design minimizes optical loss, an important factor for maintaining the integrity of quantum information. The application of this technology could extend beyond quantum computing. The work embodies metasurface-based quantum optics which, beyond carving a path toward room-temperature quantum computers and networks, could also benefit quantum sensing or offer lab-on-a-chip capabilities for fundamental science, concluded the press release.",其他,https://interestingengineering.com/science/harvard-single-chip-quantum-optics,0.8599999999999999,"key_institutions, quantum_computing, semiconductor",文章3报道了哈佛大学研究人员在量子计算领域的一项突破，他们开发了一种新的单芯片技术，可以简化复杂的量子操作。这项技术对于上海科技发展具有相关性，因为上海正在推动量子技术的发展。这项技术的创新性在于它能够减少传统光学组件的数量，提高量子信息处理的效率，具有很高的实用性和影响力。

新型3D打印机可将香蕉皮制成咖啡杯，将食品废弃物转化为有用商品,"New 3D printer can make coffee mug from banana peels, turns food waste into useful goods",麻省理工学院研究人员开发了一种名为FOODres.AI Printer的3D打印机，能将食物残渣转化为实用物品。该打印机可处理蛋壳、咖啡渣、香蕉皮等多种废物，制作咖啡杯、杯垫等物品。用户通过配套应用拍照识别废物类型，AI技术推荐可打印物品，打印机添加天然添加剂制成生物塑料浆，通过加热喷嘴系统塑形。这一发明旨在减少食物浪费，促进环保，未来有望在社区中推广。,Interesting Engineering,2025-07-26 10:26:06,"Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a specialized 3D printer that utilizes food waste as a raw material. Called the FOODres.AI Printer, it can turn everyday food scraps into useful objects. According to the team, it can handle a variety of waste materials like eggshells, coffee grounds, banana peels, and flower stems. Using these, it can create a range of objects, such as coffee mugs, coasters, or small bowls. This product goes beyond recycling food waste by actively engaging communities in eco-friendly practices on a daily basis, designer Biru Cao writes on his website. To use the printer, the user takes a photo of food scraps they have to hand using its companion application. The app uses artificial intelligence (AI)-powered image recognition to identify the type of waste. Food waste to everyday objects Based on what it sees, the app suggests printable objects (recipes) you could make, such as cups, utensils, or custom designs. With this information in hand, the printer then adds natural additives to make the food waste into a printable bioplastic paste. The printer then uses a three-axis heated extruder system (a kind of robotic nozzle) to shape the paste into your chosen item. When its done, you open a side panel and collect your new item, all with just one press of a button. This flexibility makes the FOODres.AI Printer accessible to everyone, regardless of prior experience with 3D printing, Coa added. This development is not only interesting in its own right; it could also have significant implications for the environment, particularly in addressing food waste. In 2019, the U.S. generated 66 million tons of it, with most going to landfills and contributing to climate change (the EPA reports as much CO₂ as 42 coal-fired power plants). This printer aims to repurpose food scraps before they reach the trash, creating a closed-loop (circular) system where waste is transformed into something useful within the same household or community. Fun and good for the planet Its AI-guided and user-friendly and is designed to work for anyone, even if youve never used a 3D printer. Users can customize the design, color, and texture of their items based on the waste material. Looking ahead, Cao and his colleagues are now looking to test the 3D printer in the wild. Starting with the pilot project in Cambridge, we can eventually save 15 million pounds of food and reach out to more than 2000 households in need, Biru Cao explains on MITs dedicated webpage on the project. This new printer is part of a broader movement toward biodegradable or food-based 3D printing, not just for household items but also for printing actual meals, medical materials, and even synthetic skin or blood vessels. Zooming out a little, this new printer is part of a growing trend where 3D printers are expanding beyond plastics and metals. Many newer models now work with food (e.g., printing meat, vegetables, and even cheesecake), healthcare materials (such as synthetic tissues), and sustainable materials from waste, encouraging local recycling loops.",其他,https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/3d-printer-make-coffee-mug-from-banana-peels,0.8133333333333332,"artificial_intelligence, key_institutions, climate_technology",文章4介绍了麻省理工学院研究人员开发的3D打印机，该打印机能够将食物废料转化为有用的物品。这项技术对于上海科技发展具有一定的相关性，尤其是在推动环保和循环经济方面。该技术的创新性在于其能够利用食物废料作为原材料，具有环保意识和实用性。
机器人能够像人类一样处理物体，并通过新方法感知物体可能滑落的情况,"Robots can handle objects like humans, sense when something might slip with new method",英国工程师开发了一种新方法，使机器人能够预测物体何时可能滑落，并实时调整动作以防止滑落。这种方法类似于人类自然调整动作的方式，通过“触觉前向模型”驱动的预测控制系统，使机器人能够预测滑落并持续分析其计划动作。研究显示，该系统在未经训练的物体和运动路径上同样有效，具有广泛的工业和服务机器人应用潜力。,Interesting Engineering,2025-07-26 13:33:07,"Engineers from Britain implemented a novel approach to improve how robots grip and handle fragile, slippery or asymmetric objects. The breakthrough slip-prevention method shows impressive results and could pave the way for safer, more reliable automation across industries ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Demonstrated by researchers from the Surreys School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, the approach allows robots to predict when an object might slip  and adapt their movements in real-time to prevent it.The method is similar to the way humans naturally adjust their motions. The bio-inspired approach outperforms traditional grip-force strategies by allowing robots to move more intelligently and maintain a secure hold without simply squeezing harder. Robots to take a more human-like approach If you imagine carrying a plate that starts to slip, most people dont simply squeeze harderthey instinctively adjust their hands motion by slowing down, tilting or repositioning to stop it from falling. Traditionally, robots have been trained to rely solely on grip force, which can be ineffective or even damaging to delicate items, said Dr. Amir Esfahani, associate professor in robotics.Weve taught our robots to take a more human-like approach, sensing when something might slip and automatically adjusting their movements to keep objects secure.The research is the first to demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of trajectory modulation for slip prevention in both humans and robots. Predictive control system The findings show that a predictive control system powered by a learned tactile forward model allows robots to anticipate when an object is likely to slip, continuously analysing its planned movements. Researchers also demonstrated that the system works on objects and movement paths it wasnt trained on, highlighting its potential to generalise effectively to real-world settings, according to a press release. Esfahani believes that the method could be a game changer for future automation, from handling surgical tools in health care and assembling delicate parts in manufacturing to sorting awkward packages in logistics or assisting people in their homes. Potential in a variety of industrial and service robotic applications We believe that our approach has notable potential in a variety of industrial and service robotic applications, and our work opens up new opportunities to bring robots into our daily life. We hope our findings will inspire future research in this area and further advance the field of robotics, says Esfahani.Researchers revealed that ensuring a stable grasp during robotic manipulation is essential for dexterous and reliable performance. Traditionally, slip control has relied on grip force modulation.Published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, the study reveals that trajectory modulation provides an effective alternative for slip prevention in certain robotic manipulation tasks. Slip control policy based on trajectory modulation We develop and compare a slip control policy based on trajectory modulation with a conventional grip-force-based approach. Our results demonstrate that trajectory modulation can significantly outperform grip force control in specific scenarios, highlighting its potential as a robust slip control strategy, said researchers in the study.They also demonstrated that, similar to humans, incorporating a data-driven action-conditioned forward model within a model predictive control framework is key to optimizing trajectory modulation for slip prevention.These findings introduce a predictive control framework leveraging trajectory adaptation, offering a new perspective on slip mitigation. This approach enhances grasp stability in dynamic and unstructured environments, improving the adaptability of robotic systems across various applications, added researchers in the study.",其他,https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/robots-grip-becomes-more-accurate,0.7353333333333333,"artificial_intelligence, digital_transformation",文章内容涉及的机器人抓握技术对于上海科技发展具有较高的相关性。上海作为中国的经济中心之一，正积极推进智能制造和机器人技术的发展，该技术的进步可以为上海的制造业、医疗保健等行业带来安全、可靠的自动化解决方案，符合上海科技政策和产业发展规划。创新影响方面，该技术通过模仿人类调整动作的方式，实现了机器人对物体滑落的预测和实时调整，这种智能抓握技术对科技创新具有推动作用，尤其是在提高机器人的灵活性和适应性方面。实用性方面，文章中提到的技术已经展示出实际应用的潜力，可以指导实际工作中机器人的设计和操作，尤其是在处理易碎、滑落或不对称物体时，具有较高的实用价值。

LinkedIn的Aneesh Raman表示，在人工智能时代，职业阶梯正在消失。,LinkedIn’s Aneesh Raman says the career ladder is disappearing in the AI era,LinkedIn首席经济机会官Aneesh Raman认为，随着人工智能的发展，最具创造力、好奇心和成长心态的员工将在工作中获得更多优势。他指出，职业晋升的阶梯正在消失，AI将帮助将其转变为个性化的攀岩墙。Raman强调，AI将影响每个员工、公司、行业和社会，但具体影响取决于我们如何塑造新兴经济。他预测，工作将更加重视人类的想象力、创造力和沟通能力，这些技能将成为工作的核心。,Fast Company,2025-07-26 10:00:00,"As AI evolves, the world of work is getting even better for the most creative, curious, and growth-minded employees. So says Aneesh Raman, LinkedIns chief economic opportunity officer. Raman has intriguing and urgent insights on why the career ladder is disappearingand how AI will help transform it into more of a climbing wall, with a unique path for each of us. Learn which parts of the workforce Raman sees as most affected by AI, and why he remains radically pro-human as the very nature of work dramatically shifts.

You wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times with a headline about the bottom rung of the career ladder breaking, and it went viral. Did that surprise you? Ive been in the arena for moments of big change beforewhen I was with CNN, when I was with President Obamaso I have a sense of what its like when cultural conversations start to take hold. With this one, I didnt know what exactly was going to happen. I did an op-ed in The New York Times last year, and that oneit percolated here or there, but it wasnt like this one. Aneesh Raman [Photo: Courtesy of the subject] And so this one really hit, I think, an underlying tension that were all feeling that something big is underway. That it isnt playing out cleanly, quickly, everywhere all at once. Its not like the pandemic, where we all just know whats happening and then our life changes overnight, but that it is coming to us eventually. And evidently, entry-level work is the place where were all able to focus first, as a place where something real and big is happening. And thats what Ive been encouraged by. Because a lot of what I wrote this op-ed for was to provoke the conversations about AI and work, which is: What do we do about this, and how do we get to better? And theres speculation about where AI hits the workforce hardest. The CEO of Anthropic has pointed to white-collar jobs. Youre talking about entry-level tasks. Are those two different scenarios based on different assumptions, or is it two parts of the same thing? The thing I can say with certainty is that this will affect every worker, in every company, in every sector, in every society. When it impacts every worker in every company, I dont know. Itll depend on where you work, what you do, but its going to hit everyone. And its going to hit everyone in a way that can lead to better for everyone, which I know well talk about. What I dont think anyone can do right now is in any absolute way predict net employment. We dont know so much of whats about to hit, and so much of where it goes depends on what we do as humans right now to shape this new economy as it forms. So we know historically, jobs have been disrupted, and new jobs have been created, every time weve gone into a new economy. Its unclear to me whether well see more jobs changing than new jobs emerging, and its going to take a bit for us to figure that out. But what we know is happening right now is that everyones job is changing on them, even if they are not changing jobs. And thats where we should be focused. And the data about roles that you see on LinkedIns platform, the overall jobs numbers that come from the government, are fairly solid. How fast is this change happening? Are companies already hiring fewer, newer grads, or do we not quite know yet? Everythings happening and everythings not happening, because theres no, again, universal way. Its not an eitheror situation. So I think a lot of what weve got to push beyond is this: Are entry-level jobs going away? Are they going to stay? Its neither. Its both. Its yes. So when I think about entering a new economy and I look back across economic anthropology and economic history, there are generally four phases. The first phase is disruption. This new technology becomes real. And this is, I think, a technology equivalent to general-purpose technologies like the steam engine, like electricity, like the internet. Were in that zone. So we already know thats happening. Any number of metrics of people using AI at work, weve got data. Nearly 90 of C-suite leaders globally say, AI adoption is a top priority for 2025. So this technology is here, and its in the day-to-day. Now, the second thing that happens when you enter a new economy is that jobs change. And a lot of what I looked at early on with AI is: Is AI going to be more like electricity or like the internet? And the reason I ask that is that electricity changed everything for everyone, but it actually didnt change much for humans at work. We still largely did physical labor. We just did it in the factory rather than the farm. The internet cam...",其他,https://www.fastcompany.com/91375183/linkedin-aneesh-raman-ai-career-ladders,0.7899999999999999,artificial_intelligence,文章讨论了人工智能（AI）对工作世界的影响，特别是对职业发展路径的改变。从政策相关性角度来看，上海作为中国的科技创新中心，正积极推动AI等高新技术的发展，文章内容与上海科技政策和产业发展规划具有较高的相关性，因此给出7分。文章中提到的AI对工作方式的影响，对上海科技创新具有积极的推动作用，特别是对人才培养和产业结构调整有指导意义，因此创新影响给出8分。文章提供了对AI时代下工作变化的洞见，但具体操作性和对实际工作的指导价值相对有限，因为文章更多地讨论了宏观趋势而非具体的实施策略，因此实用性给出6分。综合来看，文章对上海科技发展具有一定的参考价值，但需要结合具体的政策和产业实践进一步深化。
